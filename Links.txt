1T 1H -
The transition metal is surrounded by chalcogen atoms and 
forms the structure like trigonal prism. Another form is the 
metallic 1T phase in which transition metal is synchronized by 
chalcogen atoms octahedrally. A distorted version of 1T phase 
is refer as 1T’ phase, in this structure transition metal atoms 
are just about octahedrally synchronized by chalcogen atoms but 
with less symmetry. The 2D lattice of the 2H and 1T single layers 
is hexagonal but the 2D lattice of 1T’ monolayer is rectangular. 
Phase change occurs from the 2H to 1T take place between 820 C and
 880 C . Once the transition into 1T-phase occurs, this arrangement
 continues it’s meta-stable at high temperature without changing 
back into the 2H-phase. Above 1100 C it converted into 1T’ phase.
